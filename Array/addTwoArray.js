//Given two arrays let arr1 = [1, 2, 3]; and let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];, concatenate them into a single array and print the result. 


//step 1 defining variable of arr1, arr2 and define empty arry result=[]

let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];

let arr2 = [4, 5, 6];

let result = [];

// step 2 write a function of concatenate and save in result

result = [...arr1, ...arr2];

//step 3 write a printing console for result 


console.log(result);
